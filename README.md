# cxx
Header only C++ library of various useful templates / classes / functions

Add the 'include' directory to the include path, then include files using the cxx/....  prefix.
Subdirectories of the include/cxx directory indicate the library dependency assumed for files contained there.  For example, files in the include/cxx/eigen directory assume the libeigen3 library is installed.
